To Drug Test Shakespeare's Bones Or Not To Drug Test Them? That Is The Question4856No one is entirely sure what is in the grave of William Shakespeare, who was buried in Stratford, England, on April 25, 1616, two days after his sudden death, perhaps from fever. Presumably, most of his skeleton is there, but it’s possible that Shakespeare’s skull was stolen in the 18th or 19th century. Art historian Horace Walpole supposedly put a bounty of £300 on Shakespeare’s head in 1769, daring people to brave the curse on anyone who would disturb his bones. And legend has it that someone named Dr. Frank Chambers did just that... but then returned it. Another rumor says the skull was stolen and removed to St. Leonard’s Church at Beoley, Redditch, around 15 miles away. This centuries?old rumor is back in the news this week as clergy at St. Leonard’s petitioned to DNA test a lone skull found in a church vault to see if it is that of the Bard.Shakespeare’s skull raises questions about the purpose of identifying the remains of historical people. From Richard III to Lisa Gherardini (Mona Lisa), it seems that archaeologists, clergy, art historians, and other lovers of history are keen to disinter the famous and pore over their bones for clues to their lives, while others are content to let the dead rest in peace. This is not even the first time that someone has asked to dig up and test Shakespeare, though.In 2001, a group of South African forensic scientists including Francis Thackeray of the Insitute for Human Evolution at the University of Witwatersrand analyzed the residue from a couple dozen 17th century clay pipes unearthed in the garden at Shakespeare’s home in England. They claimed to have found traces of tobacco, cannabis, and cocaine. The latter assertion is the most difficult to buy, since cocaine comes from the New World plant coca and is assumed not to have been made in the Old World until well into the 19th century. Hemp, of course, was used in Elizabethan England, mostly as a fabric. The researchers also found traces of myristic acid (from nutmeg, possibly a hallucinogen), and quinoline (which contains quinine, long used to treat malaria). This pipe study stirred up quite a controversy by suggesting that Shakespeare did all kinds of drugs, buoyed by some references in his Sonnet 76 that refers to the “noted weed.”Then in 2011, Thackeray was back in the news with a plan to test hair or nails — if there are any remaining — of Shakespeare to see if he smoked weed. He also wanted to look at dental wear on Shakespeare’s teeth to see if he smoked a pipe. As Thackeray told LiveScience at the time, his team planned to use laser surface scanning of Shakespeare, his wife Anne Hathaway, and his daughter Susanna, then create 3D models of the bones and skulls, with the possibility of doing digital facial reconstructions. Thackeray also wanted to do DNA analysis to confirm the relationship among the family in the Shakespeare grave, and to do chemical testing of hair and nails, which contain keratin, to see if any evidence of drug use could be found. Although Thackeray floated his proposal by the Church of England, it appears to have been denied (although, by some reports, the request was never actually filed).This week’s news similarly comes with a negative result for people who are interested in testing bones purported to be those of the Bard himself.The application, the Telegraph reports, was denied by the Chancellor of the Diocese of Worcester, ruling there was no convincing evidence that the skull was that of Shakespeare. Scholars of Shakespeare also deny the claims that his skull was stolen and ended up elsewhere, and agree that there is no reason to think that the skull at Beoley is in any way related.But the fact that Shakespeare’s bones are back in the news gives me the chance to reiterate my problems with the majority of these historical fishing expeditions: is it an appropriate use of scientific resources to dig up or destructively test a famous dead person to find out bits and pieces about his or her life because we’re curious? I tend to come down on the side of “no,” but this may be because I am trained as a bioarchaeologist rather than as a forensic anthropologist.Bioarchaeologists work with individual skeletons to answer questions about populations; we can’t make much sense of one skeleton except in its relationships to others within the population.Forensic anthropologists, on the other hand, take the individual as their research subject.Their field is about identifying unknown, modern individuals, which is possible because they have a reference population: all of us currently alive. Forensic archaeology is at the intersection of these two fields, when researchers attempt to find out information about a specific ancient or historical person. In the recently newsworthy case of Richard III, the excavation and analysis solved longstanding historical questions, and was therefore, on balance, about a greater scientific good.But forensic archaeology, while undeniably “sexy science” that lets us act as detectives with a high? profile ancient case to solve, can be problematic when historical people are excavated without a clear research question and without a good understanding of the population and culture from which the person comes. Basically, without a thorough understanding of the ancient population (the Average Joes) from which an individual (the VIP) was drawn, it’s hard to reconstruct their lives – from Mona Lisa to Zachary Taylor, Shakespeare to early Christian martyrs. And this kind of investigation almost always singles out the privileged few who “shaped” society while ignoring the millions of others who did the actual hard work to make that society function.Circling back to Shakespeare, though, does testing the Bard’s hair or nails for cannabis or cocaine tell us how widespread the practice was in Elizabethan England? Or whether it was an acceptable thing to do in that society? No. If drug tests eventually show that Shakespeare indulged in mind?altering substances, what does that tell us about his craft? Nothing, really. Are you more likely to slog through Titus Andronicus if you thought Shakespeare was high while writing it? Highly unlikely.        Although I am professionally more interested in the nameless people whose skeletons reveal more about an ancient culture than historical records can alone, personally I can understand the fascination with the people who made history.We look in our own culture to celebrities to set clothing trends, to politicians to set legal precedents, to religious leaders to direct our moral compasses. Being able to know more about these people as individuals ? how they lived and how they died – gets at two fundamental aspects of being human: curiosity and sociality. Getting new personal information about history?makers and cultural touchstones helps us feel connected to our culture, both in the present and in the past.But I still don’t think we should dig up Shakespeare. It’s simply not scientifically rational.
